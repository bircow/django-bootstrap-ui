Templates
=========

django-bootstrap-ui enables you to quickly get started through a set of predefined templates. There are two sort of templates:

#. :doc:`skeletons/index`

   These templates render entire html pages. They are meant to serve as base templates to be extended and provide HTML5 and Bootstrap skeletons.

#. :doc:`components/index`

   These templates encapsulate Bootstrap components. Included and parameterized as a one-liner within your page templates they will return completely rendered UI components.
